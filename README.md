# ApricityOS_on_Ubuntu
ApricityOS design on Ubuntu Gnome3 instead Arch Linux

I made this project because I liked the design of ApricityOS, but for normal Linux User is the Arch system not easy to use. And because Ubuntu with Gnome3 has a good and easy usability, I have searched all packages which are necessary to made a "ApricityOS Design"-clone.

The Shell script which collect the repositories and install the packages is nearly done and I will upload it as soon as possible.
