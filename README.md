# ApricityOS_on_Ubuntu
ApricityOS design on Ubuntu Gnome3 instead Arch Linux

I made this project because I liked the design of ApricityOS, but for normal Linux User is the Arch system not easy to use. And because Ubuntu with Gnome3 has a good and easy usability, I have searched all packages which are necessary to made a "ApricityOS Design"-clone.
