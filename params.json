  "body": "Welcome to the ApricityOS_on_Ubuntu wiki!\r\n\r\n# ApricityOS_on_Ubuntu\r\nApricityOS design on Ubuntu Gnome3 instead Arch Linux\r\n\r\nI made this project because I liked the design of ApricityOS, but for normal Linux User is the Arch system not easy to use. And because Ubuntu with Gnome3 has a good and easy usability, I have searched all packages which are necessary to made a \"ApricityOS Design\"-clone.\r\n\r\n# What you get\r\nHere you see few screenshots of the design on the end.\r\nOnly the Gnome bar on the top make the difference between ApricityOS and Ubuntu in ApricityOS style\r\n\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/petrk94/ApricityOS_on_Ubuntu/gh-pages/Apricity_on_ubuntu5.PNG)\r\n\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/petrk94/ApricityOS_on_Ubuntu/gh-pages/Apricity_on_ubuntu6.PNG)\r\n\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/petrk94/ApricityOS_on_Ubuntu/gh-pages/Apricity_on_ubuntu7.PNG)\r\n\r\nTo start you can easily download the *.zip or *.tar file on the top.\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\nTo use this Shell script, it is necessary that you have already installed the following \r\n\r\n* Ubuntu 16.04 Xenial Xerus \r\n* Gnome3 - Tested with Version 3.18.5-0\r\n\r\nYou can check your Gnome Version when you type in the terminal the command: \r\n`dpkg -l gnome-shell`\r\n\r\nIf you still use Unity as GUI than you install gnome with this command in the terminal:\r\n\r\n`sudo apt-get install ubuntu-gnome-desktop`\r\n\r\n`sudo service gdm restart`\r\n\r\n### Ubuntu Gnome Version\r\nI can not explain why, but to change the Gnome GTK theme to Arc cause a issue in the window and you see the layout.\r\nI will check it at every new Ubuntu Gnome Version, but until Ubuntu Gnome cause the issue with the Arc theme you should avoid to use this theme, instead of this you can choose the Paper theme what is working good in Ubuntu Gnome.\r\n\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/petrk94/ApricityOS_on_Ubuntu/gh-pages/ubuntu_gnome_buggy.PNG)\r\n\r\n## Third Party packages\r\nThe script based on it that third-parties have allowed it to use the code on github.\r\nFor tha script I have used packages from this developers:\r\n\r\nNumix Circle icon theme (Linux) - [numixproject/numix-icon-theme-circle](https://github.com/numixproject/numix-icon-theme-circle)\r\n\r\nThe Arc Theme I have found on http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2016/06/install-latest-arc-gtk-theme-ubuntu-16-04\r\n\r\nArc theme - [horst3180/arc-theme](https://github.com/horst3180/arc-theme)\r\n\r\nThe Paper Theme\r\nhttps://snwh.org/paper\r\n\r\n### **Attention!**\r\nThis is a own developed script, I can not guarantee for full functionality on your system, even I can not guarantee for the availability of the external repositories. Because Im a spare time developer I will enhance it slowly and fix as first the bugs in it.\r\n",
