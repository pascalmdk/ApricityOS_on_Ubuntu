And because Ubuntu with Gnome3 has a good and easy usability, I have searched all packages which are necessary to made a \"ApricityOS Design\"-clone.\r\n\r\nThe Shell script which collect the repositories and install the packages is nearly done and I will upload it as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo use this Shell script, it is necessary that you have already installed the following \r\n\r\n* Ubuntu 16.04 Xenial Xerus\r\n* Gnome3 - Tested with Version 3.18.5-0\r\n\r\nYou can check your Gnome Version when you type in the terminal the command: `dpkg -l gnome-shell`",
